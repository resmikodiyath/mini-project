# Global Layoffs Analysis Dashboard (Excel & Power BI)
## Project Overview

This project analyzes global company layoffs data to identify trends across industries, countries, funding stages, and time periods.
The raw dataset was cleaned and prepared using Microsoft Excel, and an interactive dashboard was developed in Power BI to present insights in a clear and business-friendly manner.

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains layoff-related information across multiple companies worldwide, including:

### Key Columns:

Company Name

Location

Industry

Total Laid Off

Percentage Laid Off

Date

Year

Company Stage (Seed, Series B, Post-IPO, etc.)

Country

Funds Raised (in USD millions)

##  Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)

Data preprocessing was performed in Microsoft Excel, including:

Removal of duplicate records

Handling missing and null values

Standardizing industry, country, and stage names

Date formatting and year extraction

Validation of numeric fields (layoffs, funding)

Creation of clean, analysis-ready data

Excel ensured the dataset was structured and optimized before visualization.

## Power BI Dashboard

The cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI to build an interactive dashboard featuring:

KPI Cards: Total layoffs, affected companies, industries

Year-wise layoff trends

Industry-wise layoffs analysis

Country-wise impact visualization

Company stage vs layoffs

Slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration

The dashboard allows users to quickly understand patterns and drill down into specific insights.

## Key Insights
